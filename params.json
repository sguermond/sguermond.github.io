{"name":"Sarah Guermond","tagline":"Developer, Educator, Creator","body":"##Hello.\r\nI enjoy making things, whether it's building apps to make life easier, writing scripts to streamline a workflow, or designing a [tiny automated goat cheese maker](https://www.hackster.io/team-thetinycheese/tiny-cheese-maker).\r\n\r\nI graduated in 2012 from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Biology, followed by two years of graduate coursework and research in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and statistics at Oregon State University. My research focused primarily on evolutionary adaptations of corals to climate stress. \r\n\r\nI run a free project-based programming workshop called [Code Carrots](https://github.com/SEACodeCarrots).\r\n\r\nI'm a [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/) fellow and I'm improving the open-source coding mentorship platform [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested in working with me? I'm looking for a full-time position starting in October 2015. [Get in touch!](mailto:sarah.guermond@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
